  # Take those images and push them to docker hub (firstly I need to login to "docker CLI").
  # Via terminal it can be done using: (docker login) command.
  # We need to do the same inside that script.
  # To login securely, we need to set up ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES inside travis-ci.
  - echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_ID" --password-stdin
  # Explanation to the command above:
  # 1) We don't have a wizard like using terminal so there is a must to use above command.
  # 2) First part (echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD") - is gonna retrieve "DOCKER_PASSWORD" from environment variables and emit that over (standard in channel)
  # as input to the next command after "|" pipe delimiter.
  # 3) Later we run (docker login -u "$DOCKER_ID" --password-stdin) command and we tell to docker login that it can expect to receive $DOCKER_PASSWORD
  # over standard in.

# configuration used to deploy the app into AWS (THIS SECTION BELOW IS COPIED FROM THE PREVIOUS ".travis.yml" FILE)
deploy:
  # travis-ci comes preconfigured to deploy our app to a handful of a different providers
  provider: elasticbeanstalk
  region: "us-east-2"   # that value comes from URL from AWS application's console
  app: "multi-docker"
  env: "MultiReact-env"
  # when travis decides to deploy my code base, it's gonna take all files inside github repo
  # it's gonna zip them all inside (1 zip) file and it's gonna copy it to (S3 bucket)
  # which is essentially a hard-drive running on the AWS. Once the copy is over, travis-ci is gonna
  # inform (elasticbeanstalk)  - hey I just uploaded new zip file to S3, use that to redeploy an application.
  # when I initialized elasticbeanstalk instance, S3 was automatically created for me as well.
  bucket_name: "elasticbeanstalk-us-east-2-722678999417"
  # that bucket above ("elasticbeanstalk-us-east-2-722678999417"), which is a S3 - it holds all different files
  # and it's being reused by all other created "elasticbeanstalk" environments and inside we need to look for
  # a folder which name is = to APPLICATION NAME. When I first create "elasticbeanstalk" instance, that folder
  # is not created by default automatically. It's gonna be created when I first time deploy the application.
  bucket_path: "docker-multi"
  # in the deployment flow, we set that any time we push the code to the "feature" branch, later we create a
  # pull-request to merge into master and only after that we run travis-ci and deploy to AWS.
  # if we push the code to "feature" branch, we don't want to run travis-ci and deploy.
  on:
    branch: master
  # last thing we have to add here is a set of API keys. They are gonna give us an access to my AWS account
  # over to travis-ci.
  # Go to AWS console -> Services -> search for (IAM)
  # IAM - is a service for managing API keys that can be used by outside services.
  # Later, go to left hand side -> "Users" to create a user that's gonna be used by travis-ci -> Add User -> Access Type -> Programmatic access
  # -> Next -> Set permissions -> Attach existing policies directly
  # Those policies are essentially permissions.
  # -> Search for "beanstalk" -> and select that policy that has "Provides full access..." test in the description section on the right.
  # After step above, set of API keys is generated and can be user be travis-ci to deploy an app to AWS.
  # We need to take: (Access key ID) and (Secret access key) but we don't want to take those keys directly and put
  # them here because GitHub repo is public and everyone has an access to it.
  # Instead, we want to make use of something called -> ENVIRONMENT SECRETS (provided by travis-ci).
  # Go to projects in travis-ci -> on the right -> "More options" -> Settings -> Scroll down to "Environment variables"
  # to create specific variables which will be kept and encrypted by travis-ci.
